    info: `Luxora was born as the final project of a multidisciplinary team during my training
           at SoyHenry. Together with two Frontend developers and three Backend developers,
           we set out to create an online store that combined visual elegance with robust
           architecture. The inspiration came from high-end furniture websites, with the
           goal of replicating that refined experience in every detail of navigation, design,
           and functionality. More than a technical challenge, it was an opportunity to work
           as a team, apply our Full Stack skills, and get closer to a real professional
           development environment.`,
